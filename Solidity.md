# About Solidity

  - Solidity is highly influenced by C++, python and Javascript.
  - **Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that runs smart contracts**
  - **Smart Contracts are applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, or third-party interference.**
  - **Ethereum Virtual Machine** - is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum.
  - Solidity is a statically typed language => whenever a variable is declared, its type should be mentioned.
  - uint : Unsigned Integer
  - Functions in solidity are defined as **function functname() visibility {}**
    - There are 2 types of functions: Read (free of cost in the blockchain) and Write (Costs gas)
